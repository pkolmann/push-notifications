# push-notifications
Frontend code for subscribing to and receiving push notifications in the browser

**Demo project for [c't Magazin](https://ct.de/) in April 2018**

This shows several phases of building an own web push client.

- Phase 1: show notifications
- Phase 2: register a service worker
- Phase 3: send messages from dev tools
- Phase 4: send messages from [Push companion](https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/)
- Phase 5: build your own subscription service based on PHP/MySQL and send messages from the command shell using [web-push](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push). The included bash script creates a key pair and requires a shell with OpenSSL, dd, and tr (can be installed in Windows with [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/))
- Phase 6: create a more elegant solution (not included)

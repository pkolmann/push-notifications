# push-notifications
Frontend code for subscribing to and receiving push notifications in the browser

**Demo project for [c't Magazin](https://ct.de/) in March 2018**

This code borrows from [Google's web push code lab](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/push-notifications/) and uses the [Push companion](https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/) as backend.
